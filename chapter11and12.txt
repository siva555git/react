 =============

 we can have many slice in store

 dispatch the action -> it call function (Reducer) that will modify the slice 

 we cannot directly modify the slice

 that function we are using is called Reducer

============

. Dispatch the action it calls the reducer function it updates the slice of the store


Selector (selecting portion of the store called slice)
========

- It will read the data from slice which is in the store and update the UI where we want

- selector is also a hook 

- when ever slice modified the UI automatcally changed becasue it is subscribe to the slice of the store

- UI  is subscribe to slice using selector
